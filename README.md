## So, what is this?

So good news, I am marrying my girlfriend on November 2021th! Yeayy.. Now, since covid and travel restrictions are still around in Indonesia, me and my gf decided to create a responsive online wedding invitation for our own wedding. The main reason was so that we can still invite friends, families, and peers despite all the restriction and hopefully getting a lot of prayer for the marriage. So, after working on it for several months and after battling the procrastionation, the laziness, and also the sheer amount of works I have to do on my daily basis, it is finally done!

This is actually the first project I finished starting from the brainstorming, wireframing, UI design, and translating the design into React components. Oops, actualy the design was created by me and my Girl. Shouldn't forget about her aren't we? Hahaha. Anyway, we worked really hard to design our online wedding invitation so that it will have a distinct look and feel compared to conventional wedding invitations made by vendor. We chose brown as our main theme, and proceeded to have all brownish feels accross the design. It was really a good choice.

## Why use React?

Why did I use React not just plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS? Well good question. There are several reasons actually:

1. Since I am using React on my work, I thought it would be a good experience building something new using it.
2. I was really interested with Atomic Designs for React components. After a lot of reading, I tried to create my own Atomic Design Structure for this project. It was a really good learning experiences.
3. Just for fun. Hahaha.

## Any learning experience?

Of course! While working on this project, I found that:

1. I am starting to understand how to tie up components together to create a final website.
2. I still need to practice to write a clean and good css for styling. Before doing this project, I didn't know that file like `styles.css` is applied globally even though it was declared in a specific directory. I was really confused with this to be honest, but it was a great learning experience.
3. Typescript is really needed for a big scale react project. It was so hard to determine what kind of props does a component accept without any suggestion like in C#, C++, and Typescript.

Anyway, all and all it was really fun working on this!
Thanks for stopping by :).
